## Client Needs

A table format has been provided in the database.sql file with a few starter tasks. 

The client needs the ability to add tasks to the to do list as they come up. They also want the option to mark them as complete with some sort of indicating factor (like the background for said task changes color).

The client also wants to be able to delete a task. The delete function should remove it from both the client side and the database.
